				<h3>Learners</h3>
				<p>
					Using an interactive study log and timer, learners can track how they're
					spending their time, both in and out of the classroom.
				</p>
				<p>
					From Pattern's dashboards, learners can view personalized visualizations of
					their own data across all of their courses. Learners can also see how their
					habits compare with peers in the same courses.
				</p>
				<h3>Instructors</h3>
				<p>
					Instructors and course coordinators have access to broader analytics on academic
					behavior and study trends for a specific course, or an entire organization.
				</p>
				<h3>iOS</h3>
				<p>
					I designed the iOS client for Pattern to be simple, clean, and have life with
					transitions and animations.
				</p>
				<p>
					I completed the initial development in Fall 2014 and have since been making
					continuous improvements, including an Apple Watch Extension, and guiding other
					developers.
				</p>
				<h3>Web</h3>
				<p>
					The Pattern Web Client uses Angular JS, runs on the cloud using Windows Azure,
					and uses Entity Framework and OData on the server side to be lightweight and
					fast.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Fall 2015 I was the lead developer on our effort to make Pattern follow SaaS
					architecture patterns in order to bring the product to more outside license
					partners.

					Passport makes it easy to create interactive course content and assignments.
					Upload files, share links, and even write your own custom HTML. Deliver quizzes,

					authoring tools.
				</p>
				<h3>iOS</h3>
				<p>
					I developed the iOS app for Passport in an effort to allow learners to more
					easily access and compelete their badges and assignments. It fully utilizes the
					RESTful APIs provided by the website to allow full access to all features for
					learners. I developed custom interface controllers for iPhone, with a root slide
					over menu, and iPad, with a stacked view controller layout allowing for a unique
					user experience.
				</p>
				<h3>Web</h3>
				<p>
					In order to provide better reliability at larger scale, we moved Passport to the
					cloud in Spring 2015 using Windows Azure. I helped make all necessary
					architecture changes and plan and exexute the migration.
				</p>
				<p>
					I developed Passport's flexible badge builder for easy creation of great-looking
					badges. Users are guided step-by-step through the creation process and can
					select different styles, colors, icons, and text for each badge image. Once
					complete, the site will combines all selected options into a new badge image.

					Hotseat gives learners the opportunity to ask questions or voice their opinion

				<p>
					With polls, questions can be set up ahead of time or on the fly, and launching a
					poll makes it immediately visible on the mobile app or website.

				<h3>iOS</h3>
				<p>
					I originally developed the iOS app using Titanium, but later re-created it in
					Objective-C to provide better native functionality and reduce complexity.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to make the app more responsive and give users immediate feedback I
					implemented websockets and SignalR for instantaneous posts, votes and poll
					notifications.
				</p>
				<h3>Web</h3>
				<p>
					As a joint effort with the iOS app, we implemented SignalR and websockets to
					increase responsiveness and improve user experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					I helped develop automatic course roster sync functionality to let instructors
					directly link their course sections to Hotseat. This feature automatically
					handles student adds, drops and enrollment changes and greatly improved the
					instructors\' experience in the application.

		description: (
			<>
				<p>
					Convoy was designed out of a need to simplify how materials are consumed in
					large lectures. In the past, instructors would provide PowerPoint slides online
					and external links to supplemental materials in the syllabus. Learners would
					then need to access both of these items separately while also taking notes in
					another program on their computer.
				</p>
				<p>
					Convoy combines all of these items into a single package, where students can
					view the PowerPoint presentation along with relevant materials at the same time,
					and take notes while both are visible in a single application.
				</p>
				<p>
					Building on the concept of the "second screen", Convoy is available on Web, iOS,
					and Android.
				</p>
				<h3>iOS</h3>
				<p>
					The iOS App was developed to specifically target the iPad. I designed and
					developed a custom interface using UICollectionViews to display presentation
					slides and supplmental websites in a user friendly fashion.
				</p>
				<h3>Web</h3>
				<p>
					Built using C# and .NET MVC, the website for Convoy provides APIs for the mobile
					applciations to access, as well as a web interface for instructors to build
					their slide collections and for learners to view content.
				</p>
				<p>
					The web utilizes the Aspose for .NET library in order to convert uploaded
					PowerPoint and PDF files into HTML for accurate cross-device consumption and
					display on Web, iOS, and Android.
