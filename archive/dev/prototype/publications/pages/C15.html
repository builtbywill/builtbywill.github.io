		Abstract: 
		<p>The focus of the modeling of electron transport through heterostructures and resonant tunneling diodes has been on scattering in the central quantum region and on bandstructure effects. Realistic resonant tunneling diodes involve contact layers around the central quantum region and under an applied bias the contact region in the emitter may form a triangular well with the emitter barrier. Bound states may form in this triangular well and be the source of electron flow through the central resonant device region [1]. Here we address the modeling of these discrete quantum states in the emitter on equal footing with the continuum emitter states. We present the implementation of general, numerical boundary conditions into a general heterostructure simulator. We compare the numerical predictions to experimental results and will elaborate on the effects of emitter bound states. [1] M. A. Reed et. al, Appl. Phys. Lett., 54, 1256 (1989).</p>
